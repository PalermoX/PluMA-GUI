PluMA-GUI:
The main goal of our desktop application is to create an enhanced user experience for operating the PluMA software.
Our Graphical User Interface allows users to download plugins from the website database, display the installed 
plugins, drag and drop the plugins, and setup the pipeline assembly for their respective files. 

Electron:
Electron is a cross-platform application that is compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows OS. The user must install 
Electron in order to run our application. The process for installing Electron will be included in the Installation
Guide Document. After installing Electron, the user must set up the following directory structure.

Directory Structure:

PluMA Directory:
This directory needs to be installed or cloned from the BIORG github page. The link to this page will be provided in
the Installation Guide Document. After downloading the PluMA directory, the user must install the code directory
known as pluma-gui within it. The instructions for the code directory are listed below and will be included in the 
Installation Guide Document.  

Code Directory:
The directory for the Graphical User Interface can be cloned or downloaded from our bitbucket page from the master 
branch. This directory consists of the source code, source files, structure files, and the deployable files such as 
executables. Within the code directory is the assets directory which consists of the css files and config.txt file. 
Furthermore, the code directory includes a User Manual and an Installation Guide.

Notes:
After the directories are set up, the user must navigate to the code directory through the command prompt or terminal
to run the application. Once, the user is in the pluma-gui directory, he/she can run the application by 
typing "electron ." in the command prompt/terminal.
